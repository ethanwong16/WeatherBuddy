Overview of WeatherBuddy
------------------------
WeatherBuddy is a weather forecasting program designed to provide real time weather updates in locations
across the globe, as well as analyze weather information to provide helpful tips and advice to its users.
From warning users to bundle up for upcoming winter storms to reminding them to drive safely in the rain 
and grab an umbrella on their way out, WeatherBuddy aims to facilitate daily lives and strive beyond simple
weather forecasting. No matter the person, no matter the place, WeatherBuddy is on your side!

WeatherBuddy Mechanics
-----------------------
WeatherBuddy was created in Java and utilizes the OpenWeatherMap Web API to obtain real-time statisics on 
climate and weather conditions. The following files contain four modules: divided by underlying mechanics
for parsing JSON scripts from APIs, analyzing weather information, and abstraction to provide users with both
a Command Line based and Graphically based user interface. The WeatherBuddyClient file can be run to 
use WeatherBuddy in the command line, while WeatherBuddyMainPage utilizes Java Swing to create a sample graphical
interface for users.

WeatherBuddy Origins
-------------------------
WeatherBuddy was created by two passionate high school seniors: Madhumita Kumar and Ethan Wong, striving to deliver a creative project for their
computer science course that would not only challenge them to explore web APIs and heighten their coding abilities,
but at the same time find ways to improve daily lives of everyone around them. The idea came from pondering ways to
help alleviate some of the stress from morning rush: preparing to get to school on time, running late for work, or
waking up late for an important appointment. WeatherBuddy was created to help provide immediate, insightful tips 
on what to dress, and what to bring before one leaves so that one can focus on more important things and be 
prepared to take on their day.
